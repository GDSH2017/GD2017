                                    <li>2.3.1 We also use cookies in conjunction with the Site. Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer or other device by your web browser. A cookie allows the Site to recognise whether you have visited before and may store user preferences and other information. For example, cookies can be used to collect information about your use of the Site during your current session and over time (including the pages you view and the files you download), the operating system and browser type of your computer or other device, your Internet service provider, your domain name and IP address, your general geographic location, the website that you visited before navigating to the Site, and the link you used to leave the Site. If you are concerned about having cookies on your computer or device, you can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being set, allowing you to decide whether to accept it. You can also delete cookies from your computer or device. However, if you choose to block or delete cookies, certain features of the Site may not operate correctly.

A web beacon is an electronic file that usually consists of a single-pixel image. It can be embedded in a web page or in an email to transmit information, which could include personal information. For example, it allows an email sender to determine whether a user has opened a particular email.

These third parties may use web logs or web beacons, and they may set and access cookies on your computer or other device. In particular, as of the effective date of this Policy, the site uses such third party services as Google Analytics, Facebook retargeting, and Perfect Audience to help collect and analyse certain information for the purposes outlined above.
